          <h3>Returns & Refunds</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Easy returns and refunds.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Need to return something? We're here to help.
            <br />
            Here's our return policy.
            <br />
            From the date you receive an item, you have seven calendar days to
            return it. We do not accept any returns after seven days.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Can I opt for both refund and re-shipment?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            No, you cannot choose both refund and re-shipment.
            <br />
            If you receive a damaged package of your ordered items and request a
            reshipment, we will reship the item(s). However, a refund is not
            applicable.
          </p>

            </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            In some cases, it is likely that the packaging of the item gets
            damaged in transit over long distances. The item may be damaged
            along with the package in rare cases. In these cases, you may return
            the items to us and request a reshipment, refund, or replacement.

            All we need is the order receipt number. You can verify your order

          <p>
            <strong>What is the refund process?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            We will acknowledge receipt of the item(s) as soon as we receive
            them. All items will be inspected to ensure they meet the
            above-mentioned return policies.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the item seems new, undamaged, and fulfills our return policies,
            we will initiate the refund immediately to your credit/debit
            card/original payment mode.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>
            You will need to pay for the shipping costs to return your item(s).
